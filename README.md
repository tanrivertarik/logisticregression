## Introduction

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification that estimates the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It is a fundamental technique in machine learning and data science, widely used in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and marketing.

This study involves:
- Implementing logistic regression from scratch.
- Using logistic regression with popular machine learning libraries.
- Comparing logistic regression performance with other classification algorithms.
- Analyzing the impact of different preprocessing techniques on the model's performance.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanrivertarik/logisticregression.git
cd logistic-regression-study
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the experiments and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess the data**: Prepare the datasets by running the preprocessing scripts.
2. **Train the model**: Train the logistic regression model using the training scripts.
3. **Evaluate the model**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test datasets.

Example commands:

```bash
# Preprocess the data
python preprocess.py --dataset path/to/dataset

# Train the model
python train.py --dataset path/to/preprocessed/dataset

# Evaluate the model
python evaluate.py --model path/to/trained/model --dataset path/to/test/dataset
```

## Datasets

The datasets used in this study are publicly available and can be downloaded from the following sources:

- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

Ensure that you download the datasets and place them in the appropriate directory as specified in the preprocessing scripts.

## Experiments

The following experiments are conducted as part of this study:

1. **Baseline Logistic Regression**: Implementing logistic regression from scratch.
2. **Library-Based Logistic Regression**: Using scikit-learn to implement logistic regression.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Analyzing the impact of feature scaling, polynomial features, and other preprocessing techniques.
4. **Model Comparison**: Comparing logistic regression with other classifiers like decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.

## Results

The results of the experiments are documented in detail in the `results` directory. This includes performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model and dataset.
